## Overview

This project focuses on statistical analysis using R, demonstrating various techniques for exploring and visualizing relationships between variables, checking assumptions such as normality, and deriving insights through statistical tests.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is `USArrests`, which contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape across different states in the USA in 1973. The variables analyzed include:

- **Murder**: Rate of murders per 100,000 population.
- **Assault**: Rate of assaults per 100,000 population.
- **Rape**: Rate of rapes per 100,000 population.
- **UrbanPop**: Percentage of urban population in each state.

## Analysis

The main analyses performed include:

- Exploring associations between variables through scatterplot matrices.
- Checking for normal distribution using histograms and density plots.
- Calculating confidence intervals for the mean variable.
- Applying the central limit theorem to understand the sampling distribution of the mean.

---

## Visualization

Various visualizations are used to illustrate the findings:

- Scatterplots for exploring variable associations.
- Histograms and density plots to assess data distributions.
- Plots showing confidence intervals around the mean.

---

## Statistical Tests

Statistical tests are conducted to validate findings and assumptions:

- Mean aggregation and comparison across variables.
- Hypothesis testing for normality.
- Assessing the sampling distribution of the mean using simulations.

---

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical guide to statistical analysis in R, demonstrating fundamental techniques and providing insights into data exploration and hypothesis testing.
